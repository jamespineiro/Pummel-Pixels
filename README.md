# Pummel Pixels
 A repository to store separate game versions and files for my upcoming platform fighter.

 I update the game's files and in turn this repository about every 1-2 days depending on my work schedule. I am very passionate about this game, and I am excited to release it for people to enjoy.

 It is a platform fighter designed for couch co-op, which means it's specifically designed to be played with your friends and family right next to you. Rather than being created for competitive strategy like most other titles in the genre, Pummel Pixels was made with flexibility in mind. If you and your friends like to play with characters double the size or gravity? Have at it. If you want to play with crossbows that can shoot 3 or 5 arrows at a time? The world is your oyster. This game isn't meant to cause fights or throw controllers, it's meant to have a good time and make with it what you will.
